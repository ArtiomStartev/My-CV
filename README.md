# My-CV
This is my CV web page written in HTML5 and CSS3 technologies and a JavaScript code snippet has been added to it to be able to send me emails and be able to contact me.
The following was used to send the message:
1) AWS API Gateway - to create an HTTP API;
2) AWS Lambda - to handle an event that came from the API Gateway;
3) AWS SES is a service for sending the message itself.
